# Hey, I'm Hassan Karasu

Aspiring **Cyber Security Specialist** with a focus on **Blue Team** and **Red Team Operations**. I build hands-on experience by analyzing security incidents, detecting threats, and studying attacker techniques within real-world–inspired environments.

I’m particularly interested in understanding how attacks work end-to-end and how effective defensive strategies can be designed, improved, and validated through continuous practice.
